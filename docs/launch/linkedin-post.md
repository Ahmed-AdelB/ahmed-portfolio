**Headline:** 🚀 Launching My New Portfolio: The Intersection of AI, Security, and Open Source

I’m thrilled to announce the launch of my new personal portfolio and blog: **[ahmedalderai.com](https://ahmedalderai.com)**!

This site is more than just a showcase of my work; it’s a platform to share my research in **AI Security** and my contributions to the open-source ecosystem that powers modern software.

### 🛡️ The Journey So Far

My path started at **Ain Shams University** in Cairo, where I fell in love with breaking systems to make them stronger. That curiosity evolved into a dedicated mission: **Securing the AI infrastructure we build on.**

Today, I’m proud to be an **AI Security Researcher** and an active open-source contributor. I believe that security shouldn't be bolted on—it must be woven into the fabric of our tools.

### 💻 Open Source Impact

Code speaks louder than credentials. I’ve had the privilege of contributing to foundational projects like **pip**, **pydantic**, and **openai-python**.

Seeing my code merged into tools used by **150M+ developers** and systems worldwide is a responsibility I take seriously. Every PR is a step toward a safer supply chain for everyone.

### 📚 Featured on the Site

*   **LLM Security Playbook:** A comprehensive guide for developers building secure AI applications.
*   **Security Research:** Deep dives into vulnerabilities and "Security by Default" principles.
*   **Open Source Timeline:** A chronicle of my contributions to the Python ecosystem.

### 🛠️ Built With

The portfolio itself is a modern web experiment, built with:
*   **Astro 5.16** for blazing fast static performance.
*   **React 19** & **Tailwind CSS 4** for a polished UI.
*   **Dark Mode** & **Command Palette** for a developer-first experience.

### 🤝 Let's Connect

As we race to deploy AI agents and LLMs, security is our shared challenge. Whether you're interested in AI safety, supply chain security, or just want to geek out over Python internals, I’d love to connect.
