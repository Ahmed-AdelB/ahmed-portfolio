**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well!

I’m writing to share something I’ve been working on deeply for the past few months. As you might know, I’ve been focusing heavily on **AI Security** and **Open Source Software** development. Today, I’m excited to officially launch my personal portfolio and research hub.

**🌐 Visit the new site here: [https://ahmed-adel.dev](https://ahmed-adel.dev)** *(Replace with actual URL)*

I built this platform not just as a showcase, but as an interactive resource for the community. Here are a few highlights I think you’ll find interesting:

*   **🤖 Ahmed AI Chatbot:** An interactive RAG-powered assistant that can answer questions about my professional background and research.
*   **🛡️ Security Playground:** A prompt injection challenge designed to demonstrate LLM vulnerabilities in a safe, educational environment.
*   **⚡ Open Source Impact:** A timeline of my contributions to major Python projects like `pip`, `pydantic`, and `scoutsuite`.
*   **📝 Technical Blog:** Deep dives into AI security patterns, Python internals, and rigorous software engineering practices.

I’m currently exploring new opportunities in **AI Security Research** and **Software Engineering** (specifically in Dublin/Cork/Galway/Limerick), and I’d love to hear your thoughts on the site or catch up if you have a moment.

Thank you for being part of my network and journey!

Best regards,

**Ahmed Adel Bakr Alderai**
AI Security Researcher & Python Engineer
