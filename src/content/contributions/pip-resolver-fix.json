  "description": "Identified an edge case where pip's resolver entered an infinite loop when packages had circular version constraints with extras. Implemented a visited-set tracking mechanism with cycle detection that gracefully handles constraint conflicts. This fix eliminated resolver timeouts for enterprise users with complex dependency graphs and improved overall installation reliability."
