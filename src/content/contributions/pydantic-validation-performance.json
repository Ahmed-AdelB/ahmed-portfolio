  "description": "Profiling revealed that nested Pydantic models were redundantly initializing validators for each validation call, causing significant overhead. Implemented lazy field validator initialization with thread-safe caching, reducing memory allocations and CPU cycles. The optimization particularly benefits API services handling high-throughput request validation with complex nested schemas."
